<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>There are several ways Montreal can be installed. For existing sites that already have content, the first method will only involve the installation and activation of the theme. The second option includes a full Drupal 7 install with the same SQL database file used to create the theme demo. Please choose which installation method works best for you and follow the instructions.
<h3>Theme Only</h3>
Option 1:
<ul>
  <li>Visit yourdomain.com/admin/appearance/install</li>
  <li>Upload the Montreal.zip file</li>
  <li>Enable and set to default</li>
</ul>
Option 2:
<ul>
  <li>Extract the Montreal.zip file and upload via FTP to /sites/all/themes</li>
  <li>Visit yourdomain.com/admin/appearance/</li>
  <li>Scroll down to "DISABLED THEMES" and set and enable Montreal</li>
</ul>

<h3>Full Drupal Install</h3>
<p>The following steps are designed for people that have experience manually installing Drupal and importing databases. If you do not feel comfortable performing these steps yourself, contact your server administrator for help. <strong>NOTE</strong> this option is for a completely new Drupal install. Do not import the provided SQL file into an existing Drupal database or you will lose all of your data!</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a database for this installation of Drupal and import the SQL file that came with the theme.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/install/settings-file" target="_blank"> these directions</a> to create the settings.php file. Save this file somewhere so you can copy it over to the Drupal installation we have provided.</li>
<li>Copy the entire contents of the Drupal_7 folder to the location on your web server where you want your site to be accessed. If you want your primary domain to point to your install of Montreal, copy everything to the root folder. If you want your site to be accessed as a subsection of your domain (for example: yourdomain.com/drupal) then simply rename the Drupal_7 folder to the desired name and upload to the root of your server. Also be sure to copy over the settings.php file mentioned in the previous step</li>
<li>Login to your site with the username <strong>Steve</strong> and the password <strong>admin</strong> and visit /admin/people to change the admin username and password. The passwords for the three test users are the username and 1234, example: Frank1234 </li>
<li>Go through the Drupal configuration found in /admin/config options and update all the necessary information to reflect your website. Also be sure to visit /admin/config/media/file-system and change the Temporary Directory.</li>
    
</ol>  
<h2>Menu</h2>
<p>To edit your menu visit yourdomain.com/admin/structure/menu (pictured below)</p>
<img src="images/menu-1.png">
<p>Montreal uses the Main Menu. Press "List Links" to access the menu overview. From there you can add/remove links, and set the order.</p>
<b>NOTE:</b> <p>If you would like to use Montreal's built in drop down menu capability, make sure that the parent menu item (the one that indicates the drop down) has the "show as expanded" checkbox enabled.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<h3>Recommended Modules</h3>
<p>You can find all of the recommended modules in the full Drupal install that comes with the download files (drupal_7/sites/all/modules) but below is the full list and their URLS:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/contact_form_blocks">Contact Form Blocks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/ctools">ctools</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel">Devel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">Webform</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Montreal Content Data</h3>
<p>If you used option 1 to install the theme on an existing install that already has content we recommend you use our Montreal Content Data module to create the additional content types, fields and Views needed to fully utilize the theme. You will find it in the root of the directory that contains the download files. This module is a custom <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features" target="_blank">Features</a> module and will not run without it. We recommend copying all of the modules from the /drupal_7/sites/all/modules folder into your install if you do not already have them. After you have all the modules simply upload and activate the Montreal Content Data module and the content types, fields and Views will automatically be created.</p>

<h2>Content Types</h2>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>
<h3>Page</h3>

<h2>Theme Settings</h2>
<p>Montreal includes a powerful set of theme settings that allow you to configure many aspects of your site. They are organized in a series of tabbed menu items each with their own set of options. Simply click on the option heading to expand the full set of options. The Montreal theme options can be accessed by visiting yourdomain.com/admin/appearance/settings/montreal. All options have default values set, but you should go through each one and adjust them to your liking.</p>

<h2>Front Page</h2>
<p>By default Montreal uses a custom front page template that features several custom sections including the image slider. All of these sections are fully customizable and can also be disabled. You can use the theme settings to enable/disable any of these sections and set any necessary options. For full control of the front page template you can manually edit /includes/front-page.php</p>

<h4>Image Slider</h4>

<p>
Montreal uses the Supersize slider for the front page to offer the full height sliding images inside the main slider area and inside the highlight section. We have provided some simple theme settings to control the slider, or you can manually edit /includes/front-page.php to fully customize the slider. The jQuery call at the bottom of page--front.tpl controls all aspects of the slider, and to call your own images without using the theme settings simply change the "slides" attribute as follows:
<pre>

slides : [ // Slideshow Images
	{image : '/path/to/img.jpg'},
	{image : '/path/to/img.jpg'},  
	{image : '/path/to/img.jpg'},
	{image : '/path/to/img.jpg'}
			
],

</pre>
</p>

<h4>Recent Projects</h4>
<p>The recent projects section is designed to showcase recent portfolio items in a carousel (see the Portfolio section of these docs for instructions on how to set up your portfolio items). This section utilizes a custom view template called node--view--recent-projects--block.tpl to achieve the look and feel seen on the demo. To properly use this section, make sure you have set up some portfolio items as described in the "Portfolio" section of the documentation. Once you have some portfolio items, either create a new view called Recent Projects (machine name must be recent_projects) of Portfolio Basic content (see the Portfolio documentation below for more info) content with an unformatted list of full content or use the Montreal Content Data module found in the root folder of the download files to automatically create all the content data for you.</p>

<h4>Highlight</h4>

<p>The Highlight section allows you to advertise a specific page or aspect of your site and also displays the main slider background in a parallax scrolling effect. The settings for the Highlight section are in the Front Page tab of the theme settings. You can enter your own text and even include HTML.</p>


<h4>Recent Posts</h4>

<p>The recent posts section is a block region designed to showcase your site's most recent blog/article posts. Montreal uses a custom view template called node--view--front-page-blog--block.tpl to achieve the look and feel of this section seen on the demo. To properly use this section, either create a new view called Front Page Blog (machine name must be front_page_blog) with the desired number of blog/article teasers, or use the Montreal Content Data module found in the root folder of the download files to automatically create all the content data for you.</p>

<h4>Twitter Feed</h4>

<p>This section will display the most recent Tweet for the Twitter handle you specify. Simply use the Twitter Feed option in the theme settings(/admin/appearance/settings/montreal) to set the handle.</p>


<h2>Portfolio Templates</h2>

<p>One of the most unique and powerful features of Montreal is the different Portfolio template choices that are available. There are six different templates and two varieties of the single portfolio item. All of the different views can be seen on the <a href="http://refaktorthemes.com/montreal" target="_blank">demo</a> and we encourage you to look through them all to see which one(s) you may like to use.</p>

<p>Below we will go over each of the different portfolio templates and the two single item templates and outline everything you need to know about how to properly use them on your site. If you did not do the full Drupal 7 install the only module you will need is Views, but we also highly recommend using the Montreal Content Data module to create all of the content types, fields and views for you. See the Modules section of the documentation further above this page for more information.</p>

<h4>Basic</h4>

<p>This is the default Portfolio template and it uses the Portfolio Basic content type (see the Content Types section of the documentation for more info). You can see an example of this Portfolio template on our <a href="http://refaktorthemes.com/montreal/portfolio" target="_blank">demo page</a>. The following theme files are associated with this template:</p>
<ul>
<li>/templates/page--portfolio.tpl</li>
<li>/templates/node--view--portfolio--page.tpl</li>
</ul>

<p>This template requires a Views page called "Portfolio" that calls full content from the Portfolio Basic content type. You can either use the Montreal Content Data module to create the view or you can use the export code found in /views_exports/portfolio.txt. Visit /admin/structure/views/import and import the entire contents of that file and the View will be created for you.</p>

<h4>Drag</h4>

<p>This template uses a click and drag (or swipe gesture on touch devices) to navigate through the items. You can see an example of this template on our <a href="http://refaktorthemes.com/montreal/portfolio-drag" target="_blank">demo page</a>. The following theme files are associated with this template:</p>

<ul>
<li>/templates/page--portfolio-drag.tpl</li>
<li>/templates/node--view--portfolio-drag--page.tpl</li>
</ul>

<p>This template requires a Views page called "Portfolio Drag" that calls full content from the Portfolio Basic content type. You can either use the Montreal Content Data module to create the view or you can use the export code found in /views_exports/portfolio_drag.txt. Visit /admin/structure/views/import and import the entire contents of that file and the View will be created for you.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>If you plan to have a blog on your site, be sure to read through this portion of the documentation which outlines a couple things to keep in mind. The theme uses a custom page template called page--blog.tpl which is designed to be used with a page titled Blog. If you plan on using a blog with Montreal, it is recommended that your blog page be called "blog" or that you rename this template file accordingly. There is a theme setting which allows you to have a sidebar on the right-hand side of the blog page, or to have it be full width with no sidebar. </p>
<p>
Montreal also comes equipped with the functionality to use a simple image slider within the post (as seen on our demo). To make use of this feature, simply add a new image field to the article content type called second image (machine name: field_second_image). Then simply add a second image to the posts where you want to use the image slider and the theme will take care of the rest. If you want to use more than two images, simply add more image fields and update the /templates/node--article.tpl file in between the div class "featured" starting at line 29. If you look at the template you will see that it calls field_image and field_second_image between the div. Just add the necessary calls to each extra image field you've created.
</p>
<h2>Footer</h2>
<p>Montreal's footer is split up into two parts so we will discuss each one separately. The main footer is split up into 4 block regions which can be used to display any information you want. There is also an optional social icons section in the area where the first block region is placed. If you would like to display the social icons, use the icons heading in the Footer options to select the ones you want to display and enter the necessary URLS. Or you can place a block into the Footer 1 block region to remove the icons and use your own content. </p>
<p>The secondary footer has a full width block region that can be used, or you can use the text option in the theme settings. By default it displays a credit link but you can change this to whatever you like by either using the option or by using the Footer Full Width block region.</p>
<p>You can also hide either of the footer regions by using the theme settings.</p>
<h2>Block Regions</h2>
<p>Montreal features 10 block regions where you can add your own custom content. Visit yourdomain.com/admin/structure/block to add your own content to the defined block regions. Press "Add Block" to create a new custom blog, or select an existing block from the Disabled list below the defined block regions.</p>
